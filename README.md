# Visualisation-Robotic-Partial-Nephrectomy
This project was developed as part of my Summer R&amp;D Internship in collaboration between the UCL Hawkes Institute and Royal Free Hospital. This project focuses on using Computer Vision and Camera Calibration to align a 3D kidney model to the laparoscopic screen for Intraoperative assistance.
