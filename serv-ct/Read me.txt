Dataset Description
--------------------
Stereo-endoscopic reconstruction validation dataset. Details of each folder are as follows:

The dataset is split into two experiments in folders Experiment_1 and Experiment_2. These correspond to two separate ex vivo porcine datasets, the first imaged with a 30 degrere endoscope, the second with a straight endoscope.

Within each Experiment folder we have:

Left_rectified - left rectified images (720x576 24-bit colour PNG)
Right_rectified = right rectified images (720x576 24-bit colour PNG)
Rectified_calibration - JSON calibration files containing P1, P2 and Q (copies for each image but the same for all images in one experiment)
Reference_CT - The reference data using an O-arm CT scan
Reference_RGB - The reference data using a Creaform RGB scan (Experiment_2 only)

All reference data directories contain:
DepthL - Left image depth maps (mm depth for each pixel scaled by 256 and stored as 16 bit PNG)
DepthR - Right image depth maps (mm depth for each pixel scaled by 256 and stored as 16 bit PNG)
Disparity - Left-to-right disparity (pixel disparity scaled by 256 for subpixel accuracy and stored as 16 bit PNG)
OcclusionL - Colour coded occlusion images (Yellow - non overlap, blue - outside the reference surface, red - not visible in the right image) 
OcclusionR - Colour coded occlusion images (Yellow - non overlap, blue - outside the reference surface, green - not visible in the left image)
Other - Some diagnostic images as well as the final manual registration matrix for each image pair

In addition to the validation data, we also provide the following directories:

Creaform - An RGB surface model of the from the Creaform GO SCAN20
CT - A directory for each image containing the endoscope and anatomical surfaces derived from CT and initial registration data 
scripts - Python scripts to run the manual alignment (some editing is required to provide the root directory and select the image)
