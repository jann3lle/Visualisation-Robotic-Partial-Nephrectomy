Amend the script: 

CORRECT ORDER:
	Use arrow keys to get the alignment close first (use edge image and stereo rendering)
	Then use the scroll wheel (or drag up/down) to get the right depth (use the difference image)
	Use CTRL for refinement of the registration
	'Q' key when finished will produce texture mapped surface
	Another 'Q' will quit the program

Keyboard and mouse Bindings:
   MOTION::
	Arrow keys (Rotation about the left camera is similar to translation about the other axis):
		Left: Y rotate left
		Right: Y rotate right
		Up: X rotate up
		Down: X rotate down

	A: Z rotate anti-clockwise
	S: Z rotate clockwise

	SHIFT: Do large movements (default)
	CTRL: Do fine movements

   APPEARANCE:
	O: Toggle on off for rendering
	P: Point representation
	L: Line representation
	K: Solid representation (default)
	I: Show edges (renders triangles - useful in transparent modes)
	+: Increase opacity
	-: Reduce opacity
  
   MOUSE SCROLL: Move forward or away along Z-axis
   MOUSE CLICK-AND-DRAG: Rotate the object (MOVES AWAY FROM CT ENDOSCOPE POSITION - DO NOT USE)

   IF A WINDOW POPS UP WITH A VTK ERROR THEN JUST QUIT THAT WINDOW
	
   Quit (when finished): 'Q'
